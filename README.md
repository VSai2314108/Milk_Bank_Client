# Milk_Bank_Client

This is part 1 of a two part project. The goal of the project is to develop a full interface to automate the combination of breast milk donations. This repository is the front end and deploys the web app. The web app is used to take donations as inputs and then query from the databse in order to produce appropriate combinations.
